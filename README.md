This is our README file. 

This is our github repository for our final project. Our final project is titled "Applying the RNAseq analysis pipeline: investigating the regulatory role of cyanide in mammalian cells."
Our team members are: Anastasiia Safronova, Hyewon Kim, Jane Lee, Nana Akua Afriyie Duah.

Our repository contains two coding files: BIO165_final_DeSeq2.ipynb and BIO165_final_PCA_UMAP.ipynb. BIO165_final_DeSeq2.ipynb contains our DeSeq analysis and BIO165_final_PCA_UMAP.ipynb contains our PCA and UMAP analysis as well as analysis for stochastic consideration.


Our repository also contains the raw data we used: karim_etal_data.csv
